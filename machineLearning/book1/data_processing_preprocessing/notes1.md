I think I learned about bias and variance,hierarchical clustering,k nearest neighbors,clustering,logistic regression,euclidean
theorum,pythagorean theorum,naive bayes(guassian naive bayes),proir probability.
Actually I am reviewing them because when I learned machine learning specification,I was so confused.
Sometimes I think I hate coding coz I have no idea why some people are so mean.But I cannot resist the charm of speaking out 
all these fancy technical terminology by myself.I think maybe when I am happy,I will paste some notes as my footprints.
It is quite obvious that I am not happy today!
