I think I learned about bias and variance,hierarchical clustering,k nearest neighbors,clustering,logistic regression,euclidean
theorum,pythagorean theorum,naive bayes(guassian naive bayes),proir probability.
Actually I am reviewing them because when I learned machine learning specification,I was so confused.
Sometimes I think I hate coding coz I have no idea why some people are so mean.But I cannot resist the charm of speaking out 
all these fancy technical terminology by myself.I think maybe when I am happy,I will paste some notes as my footprints.
It is quite obvious that I am not happy today!
I think one interesting fact about coding,I can complain about its tediousness while at the same time,I can be amazed by its charm.It is not about the profession or the money,it is just about my persuit and my dream.
